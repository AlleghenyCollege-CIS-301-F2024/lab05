## Part 2. Writing About Ethics

Please write in clear and meaningful language.

__Accountability__: When completing research where the only input is a dataset, action and /or decisions are made following the analysis. In your opinion, what steps can investigators take to ensure that the actions or decisions do not cause harm, suffering or discrimination to those from whom the data was derived?
